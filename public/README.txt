Mikaela Pomfret-
Created a new logo/header design in canva because the original header had too much whitespace
Updated authors/artisans page to include pictures of featured authors in the bookshop rather than just a block of text like the original site.
Added color and formatting to the form on the authors/artisans page.
Added a neater and more colorful sidebar to the about us page using w3 css formatting.
Organized each page's content into consistent cards using my own css and w3 css.
Added javascript to the form for functionality.
Removed redundant mailing list form in aboutUs page. There is already a button that takes the user to a mailing list so there is no need for a large form taking up the page.
Updated the staff picks page to make personalized picks by staff members

Wesley Burcham-
Completely redesigned the home page (index.html) which was previously almost empty with only a logo and navigation.
Implemented responsive hamburger menu navigation using W3.CSS that collapses on small screens.
Created a welcoming hero section with clear call-to-action buttons.
Added comprehensive content sections using W3.CSS grid system (w3-row, w3-third, w3-half) for responsive layout.
Implemented feature cards showcasing the bookstore's main offerings (Curated Selection, Community Events, Local Authors).
Added store information section with hours and location details in a visually appealing card layout.
Created online shopping section with links to Bookshop.org and Libro.fm partners.
Added call-to-action section for mailing list signup with social media links and Font Awesome icons.
Improved footer with better formatting and contact information.
All CSS rules moved to external stylesheet (styles/style.css) - no inline styles used.
Added proper security attributes (rel="noopener") to all external links.
Created responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
Added gradient backgrounds and visual hierarchy to improve user experience.
Ensured consistent branding with purple color scheme throughout the page.

Ivan Liang-
Updated staff picks page to remove 404 errors from original page
created individualized cards for each staff member's picks
The original page had a rotating design with books and an external link, but didn't explicitly say which were staff picks

Jack Ashworth-
Redesigned the events page to include a more readable calendar
Added javascript to the calendar to provide functionality
Removed long and redundant events list (the calendar is enough)
Added a sidebar for more information such as contact, which is important for an events page
Redesigned shopping page
The original page had many overwhelming and poorly formatted images that served no function, so I removed them
The bookstore's shop is through a third party so I updated the sidebar to provide quick links to those stores
Updated an existing form on the original site to be mor more readable and consistent with the brand's design
